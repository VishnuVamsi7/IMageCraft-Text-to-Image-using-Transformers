# IMageCraft-Text-to-Image-using-Transformers

## Overview

This repository houses a Python implementation of a Text2Image transformer-based UNet model known as UNet_SD. The primary goal is to generate images from textual descriptions by leveraging transformers and a modified UNet architecture. The fine-tuning process entails transferring knowledge from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to adapt to the specific requirements of the Text2Image task.

## Requirements

- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library.
- **torchvision**: A PyTorch package with datasets and model architectures for computer vision.
- **huggingface_hub**: A platform for sharing and versioning models.
- **diffusers**: A library for diffusion models.
- **pandas**: A data manipulation library.
- **PIL**: The Python Imaging Library for image processing.
- **matplotlib**: A 2D plotting library for creating visualizations.

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision huggingface_hub diffusers pandas pillow matplotlib
```

## Model Architecture

### UNet_SD

The UNet_SD model serves as the backbone of this project, combining transformer-based attention mechanisms with a UNet structure for image generation from textual prompts. Key components include:

- **ResBlock**: A residual block featuring group normalization and time modulation.
- **UpSample and DownSample**: Modules for spatial upsampling and downsampling.
- **CrossAttention**: Self and cross-attention mechanisms to handle contextual information.
- **TransformerBlock**: A transformer block incorporating cross-attention and feedforward layers.
- **TimeModulatedSequential**: A modified container for sequential modules with time modulation.

## Fine-Tuning Process

The fine-tuning process involves loading pre-trained weights from a Stable Diffusion model (`pipe.unet`) into the UNet_SD model. This is achieved using the `load_pipe_into_our_UNet` function.

Fine-tuning is a critical step for transferring knowledge learned during the training of the Stable Diffusion model to the UNet_SD model, adapting the pre-trained weights for the specific task of Text2Image generation.

## Training Loop

The training loop provides an illustrative example of training the UNet_SD model on a custom dataset after fine-tuning. It involves defining the optimizer, loss function, and iterating through dataset batches.


## Fine-Tuning Recommendations

- Ensure that the training data for fine-tuning is representative of your specific Text2Image task.
- Experiment with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs for optimal performance.
- Monitor training progress by observing loss values and adjust as needed.
